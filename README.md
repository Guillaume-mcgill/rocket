# Rocket Science: Project El Diablo

This project involves the construction a solid propellant potassium nitrate model rocket. The project was started for the final project in high school and continued for fun during CEGEP. The folder contains:

- 3D pdf of the assembly of the rocket (download them with adobe acrobat to be able to view)
- A mp4 video of the initial stage of the project
